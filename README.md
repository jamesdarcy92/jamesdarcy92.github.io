# jamesdarcy92.github.io
A website created using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS where I purposely used various techniques for responsive, accessible, and mobile-friendly design. The site is also print friendly.

Some techniques and methods used:

Responsive: CSS Grid, Flex and Media Queries for varying screen sizes and orientations.

Accessible: Aria attribute usage, native HTML element vs role/aria-attribute usage, sufficient colour contrast ratios.

Mobile-friendly: Responsive design, scrollable photo gallery.

Testing has been done on Windows, MacOs, Android and iOS using Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave and Safari on all applicable platforms.
Accessibility testing has also been carried out using JAWs 23 on Windows and VoiceOver on MacOS and the IBM Accessibility Equal Access Accessibility Checker.
A Lighthouse report has also been generated for this website:

The content of this website serves as a showcase of my professional journey and the projects I've worked on over the years as well as providing an insight into my personal interests.
